# SelfDriveCar-LaneDetection
This is my first project for udacity's self driving car nanodegree

Goal of this project is to identify lane by image processing using open CV. It uses hough space transformation to detect lines and some custom filters to get optimal boundaries.

Writeup for same is [here](https://github.com/dileepbapat/SelfDriveCar-LaneDetection/blob/master/writeup.md)
